# Getting Started with Vite - React starter template

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project), and was created
to be very similar to Create-React-App, but with more nuts and bolts and faster via Vite!

## Using this template

There are 3 ways that you can adopt this template.

- Click the `Use this template` button on this repo, or click on [this link](https://github.com/samhwang/vite-starter-template/generate).
- Clone this repo, delete the .git folder and re-init the Git tree.
- Use `degit`: `npx degit samhwang/vite-starter-template project-name`

## Side note

This template assumes you're using `npm` as your installer and script runner. Feel free to sub it with `pnpm` or `yarn` as you wish.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner for unit testing.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run format`

Launches the ESLint and Prettier runner to lint the code against AirBnb ruleset and reformat it
with Prettier.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information.
